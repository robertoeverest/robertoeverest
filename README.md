- Hi, I’m Roberto Gonzalez from Everest Skylab
- We have developed a Digital Light Sensor which it will make easier to test somer IR sensor SFH5721, Piccolo and SFH7779.

Stable release link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Development release link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.json
Starting with 1.6.4, Arduino allows installation of third-party platform packages using Boards Manager. We have packages available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (x86, amd64, armhf and arm64).

Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8 level or later. The current version is at the Arduino website.
Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
Enter one of the release links above into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp32 platform (and don't forget to select your ESP32 board from Tools > Board menu after installation).
